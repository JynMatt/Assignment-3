The 2dF fibre positioner is designed to cover large fields, and Messier 67, being a relatively compact cluster, should allow efficient fibre placement within the cluster. Given that the quality cuts filtered out only a subset of stars (e.g., stars with bad photometry and non-positive parallaxes), there should still be ample bright stars to fill the fibre allocation slots. This can seen from the numbe rod stars available after the cut which is 988. Since Messier 67 has a dense population of bright stars (with Gaia magnitudes < 14), itâ€™s expected that the majority of fibres can be utilised efficiently. A typical observation setup may want to prioritise stars with higher quality photometry. You have a solid case for the observation proposal, with the potential to fully utilise the 2dF fibre positioner for the Messier 67 cluster. With a well-populated target list of bright stars and careful planning, this proposal should maximise the scientific yield and fibre efficiency.
